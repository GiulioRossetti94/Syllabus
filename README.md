# Computational Economics Syllabus

* **Course:** [link to course](http://deadlink.com)
* **Teacher:** Florian Oswald, [florian.oswald@sciencespo.fr](mailto:florian.oswald@sciencespo.fr)

## Course Description

2h sessions bi-weekly on Computational Economics.


## Prerequisites


## Course Overview

In this course you will learn about some commonly used methods in Computational Economics. The course has a clear focus on applying the methods you learn. We will cover the theoretical concepts that underlie each topic, but you should expect a fair amount of *hands on* action required on your behalf. To cite [Che-Lin Su](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/people/che-lin-su):

> Doing Computation is the only way to learn Computation. Doing Computation is the only way to learn Computation. Doing Computation is the only way to learn Computation.

There will be a homework for each session.

There will be a term paper.

You should bring a laptop to each session if you have one.

Topics will be demonstrated through live-code examples/slides, available at [advanced-js.github.io/deck](http://advanced-js.github.io/deck/).  Additional exercises will completed in-class.


## Homeworks

All assignments are listed within the [Course Outline](#course-outline).

### Workflow

If you're using GitHub Desktop, [these instructions](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/) will help explain the Git/GitHub concepts. Here are the overall steps:

1. Fork the repository for the exercise/project (found under [github.com/advanced-js](https://github.com/advanced-js)).
1. Clone the repository to your computer.
1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser and open the Developer Tools.
1. Modify the files to complete your solution.
1. Refresh the `index.html` page to see the results, and repeat.
1. Make sure all of your code is committed.
1. Push/sync up to GitHub.
1. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) on the original repository. All assignments are due at the start of the following class, unless otherwise specified.
1. You can continue to push fixes and improvements until the close date (listed in Classes) â€“ just add a comment in the pull request to let me know it's been updated.

### Requirements

You can do this in groups of 2

## Term paper

You are expected to produce a term paper over the course of the semester for this course. This 

### Requirements

you must do this on your own.

## Weapon of Choice

My weapon of choice for this course is the [Julia Computing Language](http://julialang.org). I will use this occasion to *force* you to overcome any switching costs that may have put you off from learning Julia up until now. That said, for most programmers (of Python, Matlab or R) these switching costs are small. [If you are a Fortran/C++ programmer, the switching costs are negative, i.e. you will enjoy the switch.]

I appreciate that people have strong opinions on which software is **best**. We will briefly touch upon that question in the first session and think about the pros and cons of different languages.

## Textbooks

There are some excellent references for computational methods out there. This course will use material from 

* **Fackler and Miranda** (2002), Applied Computational Economics and Finance, MIT Press
* **Kenneth Judd** (1998), Numerical Methods in Economics, MIT Press
* Nocedal, Jorge, and Stephen J. Wright (2006): Numerical Optimization, Springer-Verlag

(recommended ones in bold face)

## Pairing Tips

* Three people is possible, but two works best
* Agree on an editor and environment that you're both comfortable with
* The person who's less experienced/comfortable should have more keyboard time
* Switch who's "driving" regularly
* Make sure to save the code and send it to both people

### Instructor

Reuse and building upon ideas or code are major parts of modern software development.  As a professional programmer you will never write anything from scratch.  This class is structured such that all solutions are public.  You are encouraged to learn from the work of your peers.  I won't hunt down people who are simply copying-and-pasting solutions, because without challenging themselves, they  are simply wasting their time and money taking this class.

Please respect the terms of use and/or license of any code you find, and if you reimplement or duplicate an algorithm or code from elsewhere, credit the original source with an inline comment.
